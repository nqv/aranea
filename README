Aranea - Simple HTTP server.

There are a lot of HTTPd programs out there, but none of them meets my needs:
- Running on embedded Linux.
- Small footprint, minimize the amount of malloc() calls.
- Support GET, HEAD, POST.
- Support executing scripts (CGI) with only essential environment variables.
- Client's socket is passed directly to CGI script.
- Use Non-blocking socket, sendfile().
- Support uClinux (no fork or multi-threads, limited stack size).

To achieve these goals, Aranea is not compliant with any specifications :)

* Features in progress:
- Partial content
- Authentication
- Cookie
- axTLS (http://axtls.sf.net)

* Features will not be supported:
- Directory listing
- Other platforms
