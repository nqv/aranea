Aranea - Thin single-threaded HTTP server.

There are lots of HTTPd programs out there, but none of them is embedded Linux
friendly, especially uClinux, which does not have fork system call nor threads,
as well as limited stack size. Therefore, it should be small footprint and
using of malloc() is avoided where possible.

To achieve these goals, Aranea is not fully compliant with any specification :)

* Features:
- Methods: GET, HEAD, POST.
- Executing scripts (CGI) with only essential environment variables.
- Request headers: Range, If-Modified-Since, Cookie.
- Basic authentication.
- Single thread with non-blocking sockets and sendfile() call for static files.
- IPv4 and v6.

* Will be supported:
- axTLS (http://axtls.sf.net)

* Will NOT be supported:
- Directory listing (can be done using a CGI script. See test/dir.cgi).

Compile
-------
Using vfork:
$ make VFORK=1
Disable CGI:
$ make CGI=0

Run
---
Usage: ./aranea [-d] [-r DOCUMENT_ROOT] [-p PORT]
The doc root should be an absolute path, default is current directory.
Default listening port is 8080.

Example:
$ ./aranea -r /path/to/www -p 8080

Test
