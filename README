Aranea - Simple HTTP server.

There are a ton of HTTPd programs out there, but none of them meets my needs:
- Oriented to embedded Linux.
- Small footprint, minimize the amount of malloc() calls.
- Support GET, HEAD, POST.
- Support executing scripts (CGI) with only essential environment variables.
- Support Ranges requests and Partial responses for static files, support
  If-Modified-Since header.
- Use Non-blocking socket, sendfile(), support both IPv4 and v6
- Support uClinux (no fork or multi-threads, limited stack size).

To achieve these goals, Aranea is not fully compliant with any specifications :)

* Features in progress:
- Authentication
- Cookie
- axTLS (http://axtls.sf.net)

* Features will not be supported:
- Directory listing
- Other platforms
